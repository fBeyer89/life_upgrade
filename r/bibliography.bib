abstract = {The human hippocampus is vulnerable to a range of degenerative conditions and as such, accurate in vivo measurement of the hippocampus and hippocampal substructures via neuroimaging is of great interest for understanding mechanisms of disease as well as for use as a biomarker in clinical trials of novel therapeutics. Although total hippocampal volume can be measured relatively reliably, it is critical to understand how this reliability is affected by acquisition on different scanners, as multiple scanning platforms would likely be utilized in large-scale clinical trials. This is particularly true for hippocampal subregional measurements, which have only relatively recently been measurable through common image processing platforms such as FreeSurfer. Accurate segmentation of these subregions is challenging due to their small size, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signal loss in medial temporal regions of the brain, and lack of contrast for delineation from standard neuroimaging procedures. Here, we assess the test-retest reliability of the FreeSurfer automated hippocampal subfield segmentation procedure using two Siemens model scanners (a Siemens Trio and Prismafit Trio upgrade). T1-weighted images were acquired for 11 generally healthy younger participants (two scans on the Trio and one scan on the Prismafit). Each scan was processed through the standard cross-sectional stream and the recently released longitudinal pipeline in FreeSurfer v6.0 for hippocampal segmentation. Test-retest reliability of the volumetric measures was examined for individual subfields as well as percent volume difference and Dice overlap among scans and intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC). Reliability was high in the molecular layer, dentate gyrus, and whole hippocampus with the inclusion of three time points with mean volume differences among scans less than 3%, overlap greater than 80%, and ICC >0.95. The parasubiculum and hippocampal fissure showed the least improvement in reliability with mean volume difference greater than 5%, overlap less than 70%, and ICC scores ranging from 0.78 to 0.89. Other subregions, including the CA regions, were stable in their mean volume difference and overlap (<5% difference and >75% respectively) and showed improvement in reliability with the inclusion of three scans (ICC ​> ​0.9). Reliability was generally higher within scanner (Trio-Trio), however, Trio-Prismafit reliability was also high and did not exhibit an obvious bias. These results suggest that the FreeSurfer automated segmentation procedure is a reliable method to measure total as well as hippocampal subregional volumes and may be useful in clinical applications including as an endpoint for future clinical trials of conditions affecting the hippocampus.}

abstract = "While aggregation of neuroimaging datasets from multiple sites and scanners can yield increased statistical power, it also presents challenges due to systematic scanner effects. This unwanted technical variability can introduce noise and bias into estimation of biological variability of interest. We propose a method for harmonizing longitudinal multi-scanner imaging data based on ComBat, a method originally developed for genomics and later adapted to cross-sectional neuroimaging data. Using longitudinal cortical thickness measurements from 663 participants in the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study, we demonstrate the presence of additive and multiplicative scanner effects in various brain regions. We compare estimates of the association between diagnosis and change in cortical thickness over time using three versions of the ADNI data: unharmonized data, data harmonized using cross-sectional ComBat, and data harmonized using longitudinal ComBat. In simulation studies, we show that longitudinal ComBat is more powerful for detecting longitudinal change than cross-sectional ComBat and controls the type I error rate better than unharmonized data with scanner included as a covariate. The proposed method would be useful for other types of longitudinal data requiring harmonization, such as genomic data, or neuroimaging studies of neurodevelopment, psychiatric disorders, or other neurological diseases."

abstract = {Abstract Purpose: To evaluate the effects of gradient nonlinearity correction and intensity nonuniformity correction on longitudinal (two-year) changes in global and regional brain volumes. Materials and Methods: A total of 208 subjects (70 females and 138 males, age range = 38.1–83.0 years) were included in this study. Each subject was scanned twice, at an interval of approximately two years (range = 1.5–2.3 years). Three-dimensional fast spoiled-gradient recalled acquisition in the steady state (3D-FSPGR) images corrected for gradient nonlinearity and/or intensity nonuniformity were compared with uncorrected 3D-FSPGR images with use of structural image evaluation using normalization of atrophy 2.6 (SIENA). Results: The mean absolute deviations of percentage brain volume change (PBVC) values in the gradient nonlinearity ± intensity nonuniformity corrected images were significantly less than that in the uncorrected images, and the difference in the mean absolute deviation of PBVC was the most significant between the uncorrected images and the images corrected for both gradient nonlinearity and intensity nonuniformity. Voxel-wise comparisons showed large significant differences between the uncorrected images and the corrected images. Conclusion: Correction for gradient nonlinearity and intensity nonuniformity reduces the variance of measured longitudinal changes in brain volumes and will improve accuracy for detecting subtle brain changes.

abstract = "Measuring rates of brain atrophy from serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies is an attractive way to assess disease progression in neurodegenerative disorders, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD). A widely recognized approach is the boundary shift integral (BSI). The objective of this study was to evaluate how several common scan non-idealities affect the output of the BSI algorithm. We created three types of image non-idealities between the image volumes in a serial pair used to measure between-scan change: inconsistent image contrast between serial scans, head motion, and poor signal-to-noise (SNR). In theory the BSI volume difference measured between each pair of images should be zero and any deviation from zero should represent corruption of the BSI measurement by some non-ideality intentionally introduced into the second scan in the pair. Two different BSI measures were evaluated, whole brain and ventricle. As the severity of motion, noise, and non-congruent image contrast increased in the second scan, the calculated BSI values deviated progressively more from the expected value of zero. This study illustrates the magnitude of the error in measures of change in brain and ventricle volume across serial MRI scans that can result from commonly encountered deviations from ideal image quality. The magnitudes of some of the measurement errors seen in this study exceed the disease effect in AD shown in various publications, which range from 1% to 2.78% per year for whole brain atrophy and 5.4% to 13.8% per year for ventricle expansion (Table 1). For example, measurement error may exceed 100% if image contrast properties dramatically differ between the two scans in a measurement pair. Methods to maximize consistency of image quality over time are an essential component of any quantitative serial MRI study."

abstract = {Increasingly large MRI neuroimaging datasets are becoming available, including many highly multi-site multi-scanner datasets. Combining the data from the different scanners is vital for increased statistical power; however, this leads to an increase in variance due to nonbiological factors such as the differences in acquisition protocols and hardware, which can mask signals of interest. We propose a deep learning based training scheme, inspired by domain adaptation techniques, which uses an iterative update approach to aim to create scanner-invariant features while simultaneously maintaining performance on the main task of interest, thus reducing the influence of scanner on network predictions. We demonstrate the framework for regression, classification and segmentation tasks with two different network architectures. We show that not only can the framework harmonise many-site datasets but it can also adapt to many data scenarios, including biased datasets and limited training labels. Finally, we show that the framework can be extended for the removal of other known confounds in addition to scanner. The overall framework is therefore flexible and should be applicable to a wide range of neuroimaging studies.}

abstract = {Morphometry of brain structures based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data has become an important tool in neurobiology. Recent multicenter studies in neurodegenerative diseases raised the issue of the precision of volumetric measures, and their dependence on the scanner properties and imaging protocol. A large dataset consisting of 1073 MRI examinations in 843 subjects, acquired on 90 scanners at 58 sites, is analyzed here. A comprehensive set of image quality and content measures is used to describe the influence of the scanner hardware and imaging protocol on the variability of morphometric measures. Scanners equipped with array coils show a remarkable advantage over conventional coils in terms of image quality measures. The signal- and contrast-to-noise ratio in similar systems is equal or slightly better at 1.5 T than 3.0 T, while the white/grey matter tissue contrast is generally better on high-field systems. Repeated MRI investigations on the same scanner were available in 41 subjects, on different scanners in 172 subjects. The retest reliability of repeated volumetric measures under the same conditions was found as sufficient to track changes in longitudinal examinations in individual subjects. Using different acquisition conditions in the same subject, however, the variance of volumetric measures was up to 10 times greater. Two likely factors explaining this finding are scanner-dependent geometrical inaccuracies and differences in the white/grey matter tissue contrast.}

abstract = {Rates of brain atrophy derived from serial magnetic resonance (MR) studies may be used to assess therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD). These measures may be confounded by changes in scanner voxel sizes. For this reason, the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) included the imaging of a geometric phantom with every scan. This study compares voxel scaling correction using a phantom with correction using a 9 degrees of freedom (9DOF) registration algorithm. We took 129 pairs of baseline and 1-year repeat scans, and calculated the volume scaling correction, previously measured using the phantom. We used the registration algorithm to quantify any residual scaling errors, and found the algorithm to be unbiased, with no significant (p=0.97) difference between control (n=79) and AD subjects (n=50), but with a mean (SD) absolute volume change of 0.20 (0.20) % due to linear scalings. 9DOF registration was shown to be comparable to geometric phantom correction in terms of the effect on atrophy measurement and unbiased with respect to disease status. These results suggest that the additional expense and logistic effort of scanning a phantom with every patient scan can be avoided by registration-based scaling correction. Furthermore, based upon the atrophy rates in the AD subjects in this study, sample size requirements would be approximately 10–12% lower with (either) correction for voxel scaling than if no correction was used.}

abstract = {Functions of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) core fall into three categories: (1) those of the central MRI core laboratory at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, needed to generate high quality MRI data in all subjects at each time point; (2) those of the funded ADNI MRI core imaging analysis groups responsible for analyzing the MRI data; and (3) the joint function of the entire MRI core in designing and problem solving MR image acquisition, pre-processing, and analyses methods. The primary objective of ADNI was and continues to be improving methods for clinical trials in Alzheimer's disease. Our approach to the present (“ADNI-GO”) and future (“ADNI-2,” if funded) MRI protocol will be to maintain MRI methodological consistency in the previously enrolled “ADNI-1” subjects who are followed up longitudinally in ADNI-GO and ADNI-2. We will modernize and expand the MRI protocol for all newly enrolled ADNI-GO and ADNI-2 subjects. All newly enrolled subjects will be scanned at 3T with a core set of three sequence types: 3D T1-weighted volume, FLAIR, and a long TE gradient echo volumetric acquisition for micro hemorrhage detection. In addition to this core ADNI-GO and ADNI-2 protocol, we will perform vendor-specific pilot sub-studies of arterial spin-labeling perfusion, resting state functional connectivity, and diffusion tensor imaging. One of these sequences will be added to the core protocol on systems from each MRI vendor. These experimental sub-studies are designed to demonstrate the feasibility of acquiring useful data in a multicenter (but single vendor) setting for these three emerging MRI applications.},

ABSTRACT={Major hardware/software changes to MRI platforms, either planned or unplanned, will almost invariably occur in longitudinal studies. Our objective was to assess the resulting variability on relevant imaging measurements in such context, specifically for three Siemens Healthcare Magnetom Trio upgrades to the Prisma<sup>fit</sup> platform. We report data acquired on three healthy volunteers scanned before and after three different platform upgrades. We assessed differences in image signal [contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR)] on T1-weighted images (T1w) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images (FLAIR); brain morphometry on T1w image; and small vessel disease (white matter hyperintensities; WMH) on FLAIR image. Prisma<sup>fit</sup> upgrade resulted in higher (30%) and more variable neocortical CNR and larger brain volume and thickness mainly in frontal areas. A significant relationship was observed between neocortical CNR and neocortical volume. For FLAIR images, no significant CNR difference was observed, but WMH volumes were significantly smaller (-68%) after Prisma<sup>fit</sup> upgrade, when compared to results on the Magnetom Trio. Together, these results indicate that Prisma<sup>fit</sup> upgrade significantly influenced image signal, brain morphometry measures and small vessel diseases measures and that these effects need to be taken into account when analyzing results from any longitudinal study undergoing similar changes.}

abstract = "It is imperative that users of voxel-based morphometry (VBM) be aware of its reproducibility and the factors which influence results. We assessed the reproducibility of a VBM software package (SPM5) in measuring gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) volumes from at least two consecutive 3D T1-weighted studies in 64 subjects. Factors investigated were the inter-study interval (ISI: 2.2 h to 124 days), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR: number of image averages (NA)=1 or 2), scanner software version and idle time. SNR was measured by direct estimation of tissue noise (SNRTN) and mean intensity in noise-only voxels (SNRNO). After the scanner software upgrade, voxel intensity increased 5-fold and WM mean SNRTN by 24% (p<0.001). Mean WM and GM volume changes in consecutive studies were near 0% (absolute SD of 7 ml and 10 ml respectively). Studies acquired with original scanner software showed a small (1.6%) mean GM volume increase attributed to SNRTN increases in five subjects due to scanner maintenance. GM volumes increased with SNRTN across the software upgrade (up to 4.3%; p<0.01) and NA=2 acquisitions (up to 4.1%; p<0.001). GM and WM volumes were independent of ISI when ISI did not encompass the software change. Scanner idle times of >6 h decreased SNR by 7% (p<0.001). SPM5 failed to include visible peripheral GM in only 2 subjects. SNRTN increases were greater than SNRNO increases across the software upgrade. It was concluded that SNR changes significantly influence SPM5-derived GM volumes. SNR may be influenced by scanner software upgrades and hardware condition and should be routinely assessed in studies of brain volume."

abstract = {Purpose To evaluate the effects of inter-scanner variability (bias) and of scanner upgrade on longitudinal changes in regional gray matter volume. Materials and Methods A total of 215 normal subjects were scanned twice, at an interval of approximately 1 year, using two 3.0 Tesla (T) scanners of the exact same model. Both scanners were simultaneously upgraded during the study period. The subjects were divided into four groups according to the combination of scanners used at the two time points. Using VBM, we evaluated longitudinal changes in regional gray matter volume in each group and the effects of scanner upgrade on longitudinal changes. Results The use of different scanners at two time points significantly influenced longitudinal changes in regional gray matter volume. Regional gray matter volumes were relatively stable within the same scanner, but significantly different between the two scanners. Scanner upgrade had effects comparable to those of using different scanners at the two time points. Conclusion The results of our study indicate that, even with scanners of the exact same model, the use of different scanners at different time points significantly influences longitudinal morphometric results, and that scanner upgrade has effects comparable to those of using different scanners at different time points.

    abstract = { Purpose To detail the rationale, design, and future perspective of implementing whole-body magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in the German National Cohort, a large multicentric population-based study. Materials and Methods All institutional review boards approved the study, and informed consent is obtained before study enrollment. Participants are enrolled from a random sample of the general population at five dedicated imaging sites among 18 recruitment centers. MR imaging facilities are equipped with identical 3.0-T imager technology and use uniform MR protocols. Imager-specific hardware and software settings remained constant over the study period. On-site and centralized measures of image quality enable monitoring of completeness of the acquisitions and quality of each of the MR sequences. Certified radiologists read all MR imaging studies for presence of incidental findings according to predefined algorithms. Results Over a 4-year period, six participants per day are examined at each center, totaling a final imaging cohort of approximately 30 000 participants. The MR imaging protocol is identical for each site and comprises a set of 12 native series to cover neurologic, cardiovascular, thoracoabdominal, and musculoskeletal imaging phenotypes totaling approximately 1 hour of imaging time. A dedicated analysis platform as part of a central imaging core incorporates a thin client-based integrative and modular data handling platform to enable multicentric off-site image reading for incidental findings. Scientific analysis will be pursued on a per-project hypothesis-driven basis. Conclusion Population-based whole-body MR imaging as part of the German National Cohort will serve to compile a comprehensive image repository, will provide insight into physiologic variants and subclinical disease burden, and has the potential to enable identification of novel imaging biomarkers of risk. © RSNA, 2015 Online supplemental material is available for this article. }
